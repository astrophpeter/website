        <p> <b> "As soon as I started tuition with Peter I knew that he has a brilliant understanding of physics
        and mathematics as well as clear and perfected skills for describing concepts to people as an examiner 
        would accept them. he is an excellent tutor and I fully recommend him for tuition in either physics 
            or mathematics." </b>  - Nir, Hendon 2014 </p>

        <p> <b> "It is pleasure to recommend Peter's tutoring skills for his depth of knowledge in the subject area and 
        striving to complete understanding of maths concepts. He has a natural enthusiasm for teaching and an 
        excellent ability to communicate with people. With his help, students confidence and grade rose from D 
            to B within several weeks and I cannot thank him enough for his help." </b> - Edita, Finchley 2016 </p>
